# 🍿 Concession Stand Program

A simple Python program that simulates a concession stand where you can order items from a menu and get your total bill.

## 📌 About

This project displays a menu of snacks and drinks with their prices. The user can keep ordering items one by one, and at the end it shows the total amount to pay.

## ⚙️ How it works

1. 📋 Menu is displayed with all available items and prices
2. 🍕 User enters the item they want to order
3. ➕ Item price is added to the total
4. 🔁 User is asked if they want to add another item (Y/N)
5. 💵 Final total is printed at the end

## 🖥️ Example

```
popcorn: 1.0
hotdog: 2.0
giant pretzel: 2.0
asst candy: 1.0
soda: 1.0
bottled water: 1.0

Enter The Items You Want To Order: hotdog
Add Another Item: (Y For Yes / N For No): y
Enter The Items You Want To Order: soda
Add Another Item: (Y For Yes / N For No): n

Your total is: $3.0
```

## 🧠 Concepts used

- Dictionary to store menu items and prices
- `for` loop with `.items()` to display the menu
- `while` loop with a condition to keep ordering
- `.lower()` for case-insensitive input
- f-strings to display the total
